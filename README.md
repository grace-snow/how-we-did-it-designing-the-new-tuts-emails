### Envato Tuts+ Article: How We Did it: Designing the New Tuts+ Emails
#### Instructor: Ian Yates

We recently redesigned all the emails we send out at Envato Tuts+; the newsletters, the various digests, the marketing campaign emails, and the admin emails. In this short series of case studies, weâ€™ll explain how we did it!

This repo contains a demo Sketch file, including a desktop and a mobile layout from the redesign.
